### Trivia Quiz Web App

This is a trivia quiz web application built using OpenTDB API tool. It allows users to select quiz categories, difficulty levels, and game types, and then play the quiz by answering 5 questions fetched from the API. The app features a 20-second timer for each question, shows feedback messages based on the score, and stores the user's quiz history in localStorage. The design is simple yet functional, focusing on user experience. This task helped me practice my Javascript skills such as interacting with APIs, handling asynchronous operations with fetch(), manipulating the DOM dynamically, and overall organizing the code into modules.

### Key Features
<li>Dynamic Quiz Generation: The quiz dynamically fetches 5 questions from the OpenTDB API based on user-selected options.</li>
